## Create an environment

`conda create -n env_name python=3.6`

It is important to add `python=3.6` otherwise default `python` command will be v2.7 and to use v3.6 (or newer) you will need to use the command `python3`

**Good practice**: always install packages in a new environment and create a new environment for a new project !

## Activate environment

`conda activate env_name`

## Return to base environment

`conda deactivate`

## List all existing environments

`conda env list`

## List packages installed

`conda list`

**Be careful of duplicate install between conda and pip !***
