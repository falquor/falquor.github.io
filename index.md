# Hello there ! 

I am a PhD student in the *Vision and Learning Lab for Scene Analysis* at CEA LIST and *Data Intelligence research group* at Université Jean-Monnet Saint-Étienne under the supervision of Amaury Habrard.

My research topic focus on Few-shot Learning and Meta-Learning more specifically applied to Object Detection and Image Segmentation.

As a Master student, I worked on Adversarial attacks and defenses applied to Person Re-Identification.
